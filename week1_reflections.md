Data Structures: methods for organizing data so it can be used efficiently and effectively
There are many built-in data structures in java that are stored in the java.util package. Some examples of these are Arrays(most common), LinkedLists, Binary Tree, Stacks, and more
Algorithms: sequence of specific steps used to solve specific problems (ex. the steps in a reciple for baking a cake/instructions for assembling furniture)
Both the concept of data structures and algorithms work together in making code to be contructed more efficently and operated more effectively
